# discordbot
My first discord bot. It does things.

List of packages:
1. discord
2. tesseract
3. pillow
4. imgkit (wrap of wkhtmltoimg for python)
5. matplotlib
6. numpy
7. scipy
8. binascii
9. nutritionix

Stuff it can do:
1. OCR images
2. Add, subtract, multiply, divide and square numbers
3. Tell you the weather
4. Give you a fancy looking summary of a user's details
5. A bunch of other useless things that's around simply because this project is aimed to help me learn more python and test new things. It's rough and random.

# Feel free to use my code anywhere without acknowledgement. Its a dev project and I hold no feelings for it but nostalgia haha.
